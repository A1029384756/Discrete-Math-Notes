><b>Idea:</b> Even numbers are all the multiples of $2$ and off numbers are all the (multiples of $2$) $+ 1$.
>These numbers cover all of $\mathbb{Z}$.

Multiples of $3$ are all numbers of the form $3k$.
Muliples of $3$ plus $1$ all have form $3k+1$.
Muliples of $3$ plus $2$ all have form $3k+2$.
 ><b>Def:</b>$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a mod 3 = \text{ unique } r \in \{0,1,2\}$ such that $a = 3k+r$ for some integer $k$.

$7mod3 = 1$
$25mod3 = 1$
$35mod3 = 2$
$11mod3 = 2$

<b>General Definition:</b> $\forall a \in \mathbb{Z} a mod m = \text{ unique} r \in \{0,1,...,m-1\}$ such that $a=mk+r$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.
- $77 mod 12 = 5$ (Since $77=12*6+5$)
