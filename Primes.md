><b>Primes:</b> Primes are fresh numbers. They are the numbers that are not multiples of any numbers before them.

Can break down all numbers into primes.

<b>Primes are like the atoms of numbers. They cannot be broken down any further and every number is made from them.</b>

$\forall p \in \mathbb{Z}, p \text{ prime } \leftrightarrow p > 1 \land [\forall a,b \in \mathbb{N}, p = ab \rightarrow 1=a  \lor p = a]$
<b>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:</b> Every positive integer $n>1$ can be written <u>uniquely</u> as a product of primes, $n=p_1,p_2,...p_k$.

<b>Claim:</b> $\forall a \in \mathbb{Z} 32 | 5a \rightarrow 32|a$
