### Sequences
$a_1,a_2,a_3,...$ is a sequence (list of numbers).
	$1,2,3,8,-7,5$ is a sequence.

Explicit way of writing a sequence is:
$a_n=2^n-1$, this generates the sequence: $a_1=1, a_2=3, a_3=7, ...$

Implicit way of writing a sequence is:
Write how to generate future terms in sequence from previous terms.
Let $F_0 = 1, F_1 = 1.
$F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2} \forall n \geq 2$
This generates the Fibbonacci Sequence.

### Series
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_1 = a_1+a_2+a_3+...+a_n$
