# How can we know if something is true?
1. Observe it
2. Figure it out using the truth of <u>another statement</u>

### Deduction 
We say <b>"From A we <u>deduce</u> B"</b> <- This is a deduction
Knowing A is true and only A we can know B is true with <b>100%</b> certainty.

<u>How do we know if a reason is actually a deduction?</u>
We want to cr\doublearroweate criteria for deduction:
- Just because some says "From A I deduce B" does not mean that it is true!
- We need a way to verify a deduction is actually <u>valid</u>
- The subject of a deduction is unimportant, the <u>group</u> is what is important

### Criteria for Deduction
"From A we deduce B" (A$\Rightarrow$B) is valid if in every case of A,we must have B as well.

We want to be able to <b>compute</b> if a deduction is valid or not.
