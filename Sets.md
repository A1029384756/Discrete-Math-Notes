A <u>set</u> is a collection of elements such that everything in the universe is either in $\in$ or out $\notin$ of the set.

The only way in which an element can relate to a set is by being in or out.

<b>Arrays:</b>
- Have order and multiplicity

<b>Bags:</b>
- Have multiplicity but no order

<b>Sets:</b>
- Don't have order or multiplicity

Sets can exist within other sets [[Subsets]].

> An element and the set containing that element are <b>DIFFERENT THINGS</b>.
	$\pi \neq \{\pi\}$
	$\pi \notin \{\{\pi\}\}$


<b>Example:</b>
$A = \{a,b,c\}$
$S = \{A, (1,0,0,1), a, b, \{c\}\}$

$a \in S$
$b \in S$
$c \notin S$
$\{a\}\notin S$
$\{b\}\notin S$
$\{c\}\in S$
$\{a,b\}\notin S$
$\{a,b,c\}\in S$

### Set Builder Notation 
A way to express sets with infinitely many elements.

$\{x \in \mathbb{D} | P(x)\}$
$x \in \mathbb{D}$ $\rightarrow$ form of elements in the set
$P(x)$ $\rightarrow$ property elements in our set must have
